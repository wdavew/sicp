#+TITLE: 2.2.4
* 2.2.4 Example: A Picture Language
** Introduction
As a way of demonstrating the usefuleness of abstraction and closure, we now
look at a language for drawing pictures.

The language has a single primitive: /painter/. We can combine painters with
operations that produce new painters. For example, =below= takes two painters
and produces a new painter that produces the image of the first painter below
the second painter's image.

Continuing in this way, we can create complex painters by combining simpler ones
-- this is because painters are /closed/ under these operations.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :session

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<void>

** Ex. 2.44 - up-split
Here we define =up-split=, a procedure used by =corner-split=. It produces
branches the image into two copies above the original.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :session :results output
(define (up-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let ((smaller (up-split painter (- n 1))))
        (below
         painter
         (beside smaller smaller)))))

(paint (up-split diagonal-shading 3))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
** Ex. 2.45 - split
Earlier, we were abstracting the patterns of combining painters. Now, we start
to abstract away the patterns of combining painter =operations=. Here we define
a generic =split= procedure such that we can re-define =right-split= and
=up-split= as:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (right-split) (split beside below))
(define (up-split) (split below beside))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<void>

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :session :exports both
(define (split primary-split secondary-split)
  (lambda (painter n)
    (if (= n 0)
        painter
        (let ((divided ((split primary-split secondary-split) painter (- n 1))))
          (primary-split painter divided)))))

(define (right-split) (split beside below))
(define (up-split) (split below beside))

(paint ((right-split) diagonal-shading 3))
(paint ((up-split) diagonal-shading 3))

** Ex. 2.46
Before doing more work with =painter=, we need to implement the concept of
frames. We use coordinates in the unit square to describe images. We then need
to map images to fit arbitrary frames. We can do this by using vector
operations.

Given a vector $\vec{v}=(x,y)$ representing the coordinate in an image, we can
map it to the sum $\text{Origin}(\text{Frame}) + x\cdot
\text{Edge}_1(\text{Frame}) + y\cdot \text{Edge}_2(\text{Frame})$, which will
translate it into the frame's coordinate map.

To do this, we first need a data abstraction for vectors and their basic
operations (scaling, adding, and subtracting).

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :session
(define (make-vect x-cor y-cor)
  (list x-cor y-cor))

(define (xcor-vect vect)
  (car vect))

(define (ycor-vect vect)
  (cadr vect))

(define (scale-vect scalar vect)
  (make-vect
   (* scalar (xcor-vect vect))
   (* scalar (ycor-vect vect))))

(define (add-vect vec1 vec2)
  (make-vect
   (+ (xcor-vect vec1) (xcor-vect vec2))
   (+ (ycor-vect vec1) (ycor-vect vec2))))

(define (sub-vect vec1 vec2)
  (make-vect
   (- (xcor-vect vec1) (xcor-vect vec2))
   (- (ycor-vect vec1) (ycor-vect vec2))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<void>

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :session :exports both :results output
(define vec1 (make-vect 3 5))
(define vec2 (make-vect -1 2))
(scale-vect 5 vec1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :session :exports both :results output
(add-vect vec1 vec2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :session :exports both :results output
(sub-vect vec1 vec2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Now we can create coordinate maps for frames with this procedure:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :session
(define (frame-coord-map frame)
  (lambda (v)
    (add-vect
     (origin-frame frame)
     (add-vect (scale-vect (xcor-vect v)
                           (edge1-frame frame))
               (scale-vect (ycor-vect v)
                           (edge2-frame frame))))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<void>

** Ex. 2.47
Now we define constructors and selectors for two different representations of frames:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :session
(define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
  (list origin edge1 edge2))
(define (origin-frame frame)
  (car frame))
(define (edge1-frame frame)
  (cadr frame))
(define (edge2-frame frame)
  (caddr frame))

(define (make-frame-c origin edge1 edge2)
  (cons origin (cons edge1 edge2)))
(define (origin-frame-c frame)
  (car frame))
(define (edge1-frame-c frame)
  (cadr frame))
(define (edge2-frame-c frame)
  (cddr frame))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<void>

** Ex. 2.48
We can use the vector representations to represent line segments. A line segment
consists of a vector from the origin to the starting point, and a second vector
from the origin to the ending point.
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :session
(define (make-segment vec1 vec2)
  (list vec1 vec2))

(define (start-segment segment)
  (car segment))

(define (end-segment segment)
  (cadr segment))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<void>

** Ex. 2.49
We can use the following procedure to create painters from lists of segments:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (segments->painter segment-list)
  (lambda (frame)
    (for-each
     (lambda (segment)
       (draw-line
        ((frame-coord-map frame) (start-segment segment))
        ((frame-coord-map frame) (end-segment segment))))
     segment-list)))

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<void>

              (make-segment (make-vect 1 1) (make-vect 1 0))
